# Population-Weighted-Wealth
  
This repository contains a tutorial on creating population-weighted measures of wealth at defined administrative areas within a country using [estimates of relative wealth](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/relative-wealth-index) which were created as a collaboration between UC Berkeley’s Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) and Facebook’s Data for Good. The process is demonstrated with multiple sources of population data, including [Population Density Maps](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/methodology-high-resolution-population-density-maps-demographic-estimates/), created as a collaboration between the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESEN) at Columbia University and Facebook's Data for Good, and [WorldPop's Population Estimates](https://www.worldpop.org/methods/populations). The process also demonstrates how to utilize multiple sources of administrative area boundaries, including those from [GADM](https://gadm.org/) and the [FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers 2015](https://data.apps.fao.org/map/catalog/srv/api/records/9c35ba10-5649-41c8-bdfc-eb78e9e65654). The contents of the repository are as follows:
